        <h2 data-i18n="aboutSoulTribe.vision.heading">✨ The Vision</h2>
        <p data-i18n="aboutSoulTribe.vision.body1"><strong>SoulTribe.chat</strong> connects people whose birth charts harmonize — offering astrology-based matching, private chats, and optional meetups to help kindred souls meet in a mindful, meaningful way. It is more than a platform: a living experiment in cosmic connection, where astrology becomes a shared language of empathy rather than prediction.</p>
        <p data-i18n="aboutSoulTribe.vision.body2">Each chart is a unique signature — a melody in the stars that resonates with others to spark recognition and depth. This space welcomes seekers who sense that every encounter carries purpose — that synchronicity guides connection, and that growth and joy emerge through relationships that feel destined. <strong>SoulTribe.chat</strong> offers a safe, minimalist, and conscious environment where these connections can naturally unfold.</p>
      </section>

      <p data-i18n="aboutSoulTribe.transition">Before delving deeper, let’s move from the idea of cosmic connection to the community it creates — the <strong>SoulTribe</strong> itself.</p>

      <section>
        <h2 data-i18n="aboutSoulTribe.soultribe.heading">🌠 What Is a SoulTribe?</h2>
        <p data-i18n="aboutSoulTribe.soultribe.body1">A <strong>SoulTribe</strong> is not just a network or a list of friends — it is a resonance field. It is the invisible web that connects those who share frequency, purpose, and rhythm of spirit. When you meet members of your tribe, recognition is instant: conversation feels like remembering rather than introducing. Time softens its edges, and the space between words becomes sacred.</p>
        <p data-i18n="aboutSoulTribe.soultribe.body2">Within your SoulTribe, you are fully seen — valued for your essence, not your image. Each person becomes a mirror: some reflect your strengths, others your lessons, and a few remind you of what you are capable of becoming. They awaken courage, authenticity, and the knowing that belonging is not about similarity but resonance.</p>
        <p data-i18n="aboutSoulTribe.soultribe.body3">Your tribe may consist of artists, dreamers, healers, scientists, or quiet souls walking their truth. What unites you is not background or belief — it is vibration.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 data-i18n="aboutSoulTribe.power.heading">🔥 The Power of a Tribe</h2>
        <p data-i18n="aboutSoulTribe.power.body1">Just as every SoulTribe forms through shared resonance, its true strength emerges in the collective energy that grows from those connections.</p>
        <p data-i18n="aboutSoulTribe.power.body2">We grow faster, heal deeper, and dream bigger when we are witnessed by others walking beside us. Humans have always thrived in circles — it is our ancient design. A tribe magnifies energy: what one sparks, another sustains; what one dreams, another grounds. In this shared field, synchronicities multiply and collective evolution accelerates.</p>
        <p data-i18n="aboutSoulTribe.power.body3">As you engage, you may notice how your own energy expands. Ideas find momentum, creativity flows, intuition sharpens. The tribe becomes a mirror, a teacher, and a circle of empowerment — reminding you that the path of the soul was never meant to be walked alone.</p>
        <p data-i18n="aboutSoulTribe.power.body4">Within <strong>SoulTribe.chat</strong>, the idea of a “tribe” is not about exclusivity but synergy. Here, individuality and togetherness coexist beautifully. Each person contributes their frequency, forming a living constellation of consciousness — each point of light illuminating the others.</p>

        <h2 data-i18n="aboutSoulTribe.astro.heading">☀️ Astro &amp; Soul</h2>
        <p data-i18n="aboutSoulTribe.astro.body1">Astrology on <strong>SoulTribe.chat</strong> bridges insight and connection while honoring your privacy and consent. Only essential birth data is used to generate compatibility insights, and nothing is shared or stored beyond what’s needed for your experience.</p>
        <p data-i18n="aboutSoulTribe.astro.body2">Using your birth details, the platform calculates planetary positions and compares them with others to reveal areas of natural harmony, emotional resonance, and potential growth. Instead of overwhelming users with data, results are distilled into clear indicators of compatibility — showing where energies align and how relationships can evolve.</p>
        <p data-i18n="aboutSoulTribe.astro.body3">This is not <em>dating by sign</em>; it is <strong>soul resonance by design</strong>, where charts guide understanding and connection. Whether the outcome is romantic chemistry, creative collaboration, or a deep friendship, <strong>SoulTribe.chat</strong> helps you recognize why certain people feel instantly familiar — and how every meeting becomes a mirror for your soul.</p>

      <section>
        <h2 data-i18n="aboutSoulTribe.soulmates.heading">💫 Soulmates and Beyond</h2>
        <p data-i18n="aboutSoulTribe.soulmates.body1">The word <em>soulmate</em> often narrows the imagination to romance, but soulmates appear in many forms. They can be the friend who reawakens your laughter, the teacher who challenges your limits, or the stranger whose presence feels instantly familiar. <strong>SoulTribe.chat</strong> expands this idea — guiding you not to “the one,” but to <strong>the many</strong> who carry pieces of your evolution.</p>
        <p data-i18n="aboutSoulTribe.soulmates.body2">Some connections ignite electricity — intense and transformative. Others offer quiet peace, grounding your energy in shared stillness. Each meeting is a step toward wholeness, a reminder that the soul’s journey is a mosaic of sacred encounters. To meet your tribe is to meet yourself — reflected in a thousand living mirrors.</p>

        <p><strong data-i18n="aboutSoulTribe.manifesto.intro">Find your frequency, and find your tribe.</strong></p>
        <p data-i18n="aboutSoulTribe.manifesto.body1">Connection is sacred — every conversation rooted in presence can become a portal to awareness. Technology should serve consciousness, nurturing intimacy instead of distraction. Astrology, used with compassion and clarity, reveals not destiny but <strong>freedom through understanding</strong>. When tribes align, they form radiant constellations that shine brighter together than alone.</p>
        <p data-i18n="aboutSoulTribe.manifesto.body2"><strong>SoulTribe.chat</strong> reminds us that we are not wanderers beneath a distant sky, but luminous threads in a shared tapestry of creation. Each meeting is a spark in the greater fire of awakening, each conversation a heartbeat in the rhythm of something vast and sacred.</p>
        <p><strong data-i18n="aboutSoulTribe.manifesto.closing">Together, we remember who we are — one tribe of many souls.</strong></p>
