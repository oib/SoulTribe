# Welcome to SoulTribe.chat 🌌

SoulTribe.chat is a space created to help you find and connect with your soul tribe — people who resonate with your energy, your spirit, and your journey. ✨

## How It Works

1. **Create Your Profile**
   Enter your birth details (date, time, and place). This allows us to calculate your astrological chart — your unique soul map.

2. **Discover Your Matches**
   Our system compares your chart with others to highlight connections based on compatibility, harmony, and spiritual resonance.

3. **Start the Conversation**
   Once you find a match, you can invite them to chat directly here on SoulTribe.chat. Communication is safe, private, and centered on shared growth.

4. **Meet Up (Optional)**
   When both sides agree, you can schedule a meetup — either in person or through a video call (powered by Jitsi). This step is completely optional and always requires mutual consent.

## Why SoulTribe.chat?

* 🌙 **Astrology-Based Matching** – go deeper than swipes and photos, connect through your cosmic blueprint.

## How Matching Works (Short Version)

We compute key relational indicators from your chart and compare them with others to find resonance. We prioritize harmony, complementarity, and potential for growth over generic popularity metrics.

## Pro Tips
